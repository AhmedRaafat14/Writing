Be sure to choose an editor you like. Understand what's on the market an make sure you know the main features of each editor. I decided to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) since it was very easy to get going and is very customizable.
> Atom’s core is very unique from other text editors in that it is “hackable to the core.” Because of this, the code editor is a tool that can be customized to do almost anything. In fact, there’s even a built-in package manager to download community-developed addons (there are tons of useful packages available that make coding much more flexible in Atom).

With that in mind I tried to enhance it for writing purposes.

## Set up your basic atom environment 🔻
Style your syntax highlighting and themes as you please. Scroll through your core settings and configure it the way you like.
- Understand the **splitting pane** feature, which allows you to split your window. This way you can set your layout easily and simplifies previewing your markdown files or comparing with other files.
- Use **multi select** with pressing `cmd` while clicking. It allows to have multiple cursors in your document.
- Be aware of your **package management** which allows you to edit your settings for your packages.
- Use the **mini map** feature to navigate through longer files
-

**Key shortcuts are (Mac):**
- **cmd + p**: opening a file with the [fuzzy finder](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder)
- **cmd + f**: opening the *find and replace* panel (also possible to open *find in project*)
