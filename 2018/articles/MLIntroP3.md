In this article I revisit the learned material from the amazing [machine learning course by Andre Ng on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and create an overview about the concepts. All quotes refer to the material from the course if not explicitly stated otherwise.

## Support Vector Machines

### Mathematical Definition

Instead of regularizing the second term with lambda like we did in the original cost function:

Now we want to regularize the first term with the parameter C and adding a new cost function (cost1 and cost0) for transpose theta:

### Large Margin Classifier

This wraps up the second part. In the next one, support vector machines and unsupervised learning will be described. Stay tuned!
