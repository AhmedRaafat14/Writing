Since I started programming on my own while studying law and having work in tax, I though it is important so see coding not only as a path to already established programming jobs, but rather create your own role with it. Here are some thoughts on how to compliment programming with other fields of expertise. 
(This article was created as brainstorming for a talk I gave)

## Definitions

First of all it's important to define the term programming as I am going to use it. I not only refer to it as the mere act of writing code and creating an application but rather to use newest technology (that often involves programming) to improve the status quo. It is basically the idea of digitalization in a more concise way.

## Why are we using programming?

Loops, conditionals, variables and functions are all concepts that help to abstract a problem and solve it in the language of a computer. 

Why are we using a computer? Because it is faster. Way faster. Or better, it is as fast as you like. ;) It runs also as long as you like and never gets tired. 

So why not use it for other things than browsing the internet or playing computer games?

As a young programmer you tend to only look at things that are already available and try to work with them. But better try to use creativity and create something new. 

For example: Law.

## What are some basic principles for law?

As Elon Musk said that he would always reason from first principles rather than analogy. So what are some first principles of law?

This heavily depends on the type of law you are having in your state. For simplicity let's assume this an established and working democracy. This means that the law is made by the people living in that state. Let's also assume that people and all process around the law are bound to the law itself. 

Now a first distinction has to be made what type of law are we dealing with. This is important, because the purpose and arrangement of the law depends on it's goals.

To illustrate this, let's have civil law and public law. Both shall regulate the behavior of people of course. Both shall provide guidelines on how to behave correctly with other people. However, the main difference is that civil law is concerned with regulating behavior of people acting with other people, whereas public law addresses the rights of an individual against the state (which is ultimately the biggest group of people). Therefore the legislative text has to take the disbalance of power in account. In civil law it can be fair to treat similar people similarly. In contrast, in public law, the individual gains much more rights in a case against the state to compensate the disbalance in power. 

A great example for a combination with programming is tax law. Not only does tax law offer a solution for natural language processing, but also for actually calculating a tax burden. 

## Combining principles - an example

Let's say we want to reduce the tax burden of an individual. How can this be done using knowledge in programming? 





## Legal Tech available

First you look at your available market. In my case these are Austrian law firms or international companies that have a subsidiary in Austria. I realized that, apart from document management, no new technology is used often. 

Having a look at the international market of technical solutions, there already exists software for:
- Contract Review ({LawGeex})
- Legal Analytics (Brightflag)
- Prediction Software (Lexpredict)
- Improved Search/eDiscovery (Brainspace)
- Legal Research (Ross)
- Contract Due Diligence (kira)
- Intellectual Property (TrademarkNow)
- Improved Customer Management/eBilling (Smokeball)
- Expertise Automation/Robot Lawyer (Lisa)

After having a look at some of these implementations it is much easier to see possibilities for your own ideas and create your own.
