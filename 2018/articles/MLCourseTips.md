The Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng on Coursera is brilliant. I enjoyed it a lot. Andrew breaks complex topics down and makes them understandable for everyone. Since this course is definitely not easy I want to provide some tips for other students that are currently on this curriculum.

## The complexity of the course

The complexity of this course is twofold. 
1. The content goes into depth of math and statistics
2. To make progress you have to finish quizzes and programming assignments

To fully grasp the use of all concepts in this course I think it is necessary to do more than just following along. Going though the course and finishing everything is just one step. I think the real value lies in revisiting all topics and trying to apply it to your own use cases. That's important to keep in mind.

## The programming assignments

This is tough. Especially if you are not familiar with programming. But even if you have no experience with any programming language, this course provides a soft introduction to it and allows to apply basic principles for powerful results.

I have used Matlab for all the challenges. I simply wanted to try it and thought there must be good documentation behind this product. And I wasn't disappointed.

### 1. Read the documentation

As someone who learned programming on his own, I have dealt with this problem before. One important thing is to READ THE DOCUMENTAION. This is always the most important step. 

For this course this applies for using Matlab features. The reason Matlab and Octave are recommended, is because they already offer a good variety of computing features with a solid performance. 

Let's take multiplying as illustration:

Matlab perfectly documents this [here](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mtimes.html).

When you are trying to multiply vectors ( and you are going to multiply many vectors ) just reading this documentation helps to prevent a lot of problems. ( As I often have encountered and seen in forums )

Especially as it says in the description: 

> "That is, A*B is typically not equal to B*A."
