I consider myself a productive person. Of course I like to drink caffeinated beverages to maximize my outcome. Recently I came across this article and thought it might be worth sharing my thoughts on it.

This article relies heavily on [this research paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jsr.12711) and my personal experiences.
