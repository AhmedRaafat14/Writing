Exploring Tensorflow brings me to the first question. What is a Tensor and why is the library called Tensorflow?
Maybe I can put it in easy language.
Let's see!

## 

As the developers put it on their website: 

> TensorFlow, as the name indicates, is a framework to define and run computations involving tensors. A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.

Basically tensors are n-dimensional arrays. Those arrays shall flow between operations.
