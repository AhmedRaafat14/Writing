I consider myself a productive person. Of course I like to drink caffeinated beverages to maximize my outcome. Recently I came across this article and thought it might be worth sharing my thoughts on it.

This article relies heavily on [this research paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jsr.12711) and my personal experiences.

## The research paper

I refer to the [research paper on "Caffeine dosing strategies to optimize alertness during sleeploss"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jsr.12711) by Francisco G. Vital-Lopez, Sridhar Ramakrishnan, Tracy J. Doty, Thomas J. Balkin and Jaques Reifman. 

As they put it in the summary: 
> In this work, we provide an optimization algorithm, suited for mobile computing platforms, to determine when and how much caffeine to consume, so as to safely maximize neurobehavioural performance at the desired time of the day, under any sleep-loss condition

I assume that many ambitious people have once in their lifetime suffered from a form of sleep loss and therefore this findings can help to improve the use of caffeine. I most certainly was curious.

 Since standard algorithms were not able to solve the optimization problem in a reasonable computational time they looked for an approximate solution using the tabu search algorithm.

 The goal was a twofold optimization:
 1. enhancing neurobehavioural performance and 
 1. reducing caffeine consumption
