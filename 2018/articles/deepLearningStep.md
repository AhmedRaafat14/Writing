This article serves as a reminder for me on how to (generally) approach a deep learning architecture.

## General Implementation Workflow

1. Initialize parameters / Define hyperparameters
2. Loop for num_iterations:
    a. Forward propagation
    b. Compute cost function
    c. Backward propagation
    d. Update parameters (using parameters, and grads from backprop) 
4. Use trained parameters to predict labels
