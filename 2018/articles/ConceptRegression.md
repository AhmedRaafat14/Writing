## What Regression analysis is all about 

The Regression analysis is a statistical method evaluating the relationship between different variables. 

This can be a very powerful tool in decision making. If you think certain variables in your everyday life, for example profits and sales, have a relationship, this method helps evaluate your assumptions and provide additional information for future actions. The benefits apply to as well for business men of highest rank deciding future plans in their businesses but also for ordinary people trying to improve their day-to-day decisions.
