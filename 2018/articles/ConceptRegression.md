## What Regression analysis is all about 

The Regression analysis is a statistical method evaluating the relationship between different variables. 

This can be a very powerful tool in decision making. If you think certain variables in your everyday life, for example profits and sales, have a relationship, this method helps evaluate your assumptions and provide additional information for future actions. The benefits apply to as well for business men of highest rank deciding future plans in their businesses but also for ordinary people trying to improve their day-to-day decisions.

# How to apply this concept

For simplicity reasons I want to explain the simple linear regression concept, because it is already effective and easy to apply.

In this case we need to find a one(!) variable, which is dependent on another variable. An easy example would be sales and profit. 
The Profit variable is directly dependent on the sales variable. 

An important factor is linearity, which means that the factor follows the linear equation.

As wikipedia defines it: 
>"A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable (however, different variables may occur in different terms)."

Or simple: When scatter plotted on a graph, the relationship can be illustrated on a straight line.
