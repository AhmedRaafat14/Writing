In this article I revisit the learned material from the amazing [machine learning course by Andre Ng on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and create an overview about the concepts. All quotes refer to the material from the course if not explicitly stated otherwise.

## Neural Networks Model Representation

For neural networks we take the findings from exploring the statistical regression and try to put it in brain-like architecture.

The used terms change a little as the logistic function is often referred to as the sigmoid activation function and the theta parameters as weights. The underlying concept stays the same. Instead of the [bias term theta 0, now a bias unit with the value of 1 is used.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2480650/role-of-bias-in-neural-networks)

This wraps up the second part. In the next one, neural networks will be described. Stay tuned!
