## Function of a Neuron (-model)

- Dentrite is for Input.
- Axon is for Output

A neuron model computes the input wires and outputs the value of a hypothesis X.
Make sure to add a "bias unit" as an input.

## Neural network

A neural network are more neurons tied together.
Basically the network consists of 3 layers:
1. Input layer
1. Hidden layer
1. Output layer
