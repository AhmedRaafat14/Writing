### 1. Improving writing on a Computer
The advantages of using a PC are endless. So learning to improve your actual writing skills on keyboard seems like a logical next step for becoming a more efficient human being.

### 2. Getting more comfortable with Atom as an editor
In Coding it's absolutely necessary to understand and use a very proficient text editor. Browsing through the web I came to the conclusion that atom is the most suitable for me. The more I use and write in it, the better I get  in my coding endeavor.

### 3. Improve English enunciation
English is key in every aspect of life. It's 2017 and we have to think in global and international scales. Thus improving the ability to express yourself in good english phrases is necessary to stay relevant in the business world.

### 4. Get comfortable writing regularly
Although voice recordings and video journals are on the rise, nothing will trump writing. A level of comfort writing about certain topics will allow you to get out your experience and knowledge out to the world.

### 5. Structure learning with writing thoughts down and organising them
This last one is actually the most important one for me. It's learning on paper. Knowledge is power, and writing, yes thinking on paper, is the best way to learn about a topic (at least for me). It's easy to just read or consume information and knowledge. But putting it into action, into practice, connecting dots and subsume onto your life is a different story. it's also a great way to get your insights out to the world and be able to receive feedback in any kind of form.

#### üöÄ A goal written down is a goal acted upon - So let's do it!
