Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a very often used software design pattern for implementing user interfaces. Since I tried to use and understand the structure in my last projects, I decided to take a deeper look into it. I want to focus on the model in the React environment.

### What is MVC?
MVC is a way of thinking to structure your web application. It's popular because it's used by many frameworks that implement that structure (rails, cakephp, django etc.).
The architecture stems from the traditional flow of a web application.

1. **View - Client**
Displays visualization of the data to the user. Only connected to the controller.
2. **Controller - Server**
Processes server-side logic and acts as a middleware between View and Model, i.e. controlling the flow of data.
3. **Model - Database**
Processing data from or to the database. Only connected to the controller.
