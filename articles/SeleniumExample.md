In my previous article I described how to use JavaScript in the browser console to get tedious tasks on the web much faster done. Of course this approach is limited. A way to go much further and beyond is to use a automation framework like Selenium. In this article I show how flexible and fast you can program a script that helps you save a lot of time.
