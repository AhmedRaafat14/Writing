#### Shallow rendering

This is used to test the component on it's own. Isolated from other components. This is especially useful for testing representational or "dumb" React components.

As [their docs](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html) say:
> Shallow rendering is useful to constrain yourself to testing a component as a unit, and to ensure that your tests aren't indirectly asserting on behavior of child components.

#### Full rendering

#### Static rendering
