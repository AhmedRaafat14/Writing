Since I am getting more and more advanced, now it was time to take a look into Typescript. Not because of the simple transpiling of JavaScript, but rather because of the static typing concept.

For most of my conclusions I refer to: 

- [The Github repository and wiki of Microsoft (who maintains the project)](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals)
- [TypeScript DeepDive Gitbook by Basarat Ali Syed and it's contributors](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/why-typescript.html)
