Since I am getting more and more advanced, now it was time to take a look into Typescript. Not because of the simple linting of JavaScript, but rather because of the static typing concept.

For most of my conclusions I refer to: 

- [The Github repository and wiki of Microsoft (who maintains the project)](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals)
- [TypeScript DeepDive Gitbook by Basarat Ali Syed and it's contributors](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/why-typescript.html)

## What is it and where is it heading?

The idea behind TypeScript is to provide an optional type system for JavaScript. 

It enhances code quality by
- increase your agility when doing refactoring. It's better for the compiler to catch errors than to have things fail at runtime.
- types are one of the best forms of documentation you can have. The function signature is a theorem and the function body is the proof.

> Your JavaScript code .js file can be renamed to a .ts file and TypeScript will still give you back valid .js equivalent to the original JavaScript file. TypeScript is intentionally and strictly a superset of JavaScript with optional Type checking.

It's goals (according to the official documentation) are:
- Statically identify constructs that are likely to be errors.
- Provide a structuring mechanism for larger pieces of code.
- Impose no runtime overhead on emitted programs.
- Emit clean, idiomatic, recognizable JavaScript code.
- Produce a language that is composable and easy to reason about.
- Align with current and future ECMAScript proposals.
- Preserve runtime behavior of all JavaScript code.
- Avoid adding expression-level syntax.
- Use a consistent, fully erasable, structural type system.
- Be a cross-platform development tool.
- Do not cause substantial breaking changes from TypeScript 1.0.
