Structuring contracts can be a very difficult task. Combining that with services in volatile environments and asynchronous information distribution, the overall value of this task can decrease at best and provide legal traps at worst. Immerse yourself in some newer concepts, that I came across working working on a project.

This article is mainly aimed at entrepreneurs, who have to deal heavily with lawyers and contracts. It should broaden your understanding of contracting in a more professional manner.

Disclaimer: Those concepts do work well in Austrian and German Law. I don't know how they fit in other legislation, but rest assure: The concept itself is not bound to the legal sector.

## Current situation and 90% of all contracts

As I have seen, most of the contracts are written poorly. A main distinction has to be made between whether a product or a service is owed under the contract.
