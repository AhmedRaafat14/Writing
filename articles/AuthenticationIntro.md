Authentication is an important issue when creating a dynamic web application. This article should clear things up and provide a basic instruction.

## Authentication?

Authentication is for identifying users and provide different access rights and content depending on their id.
In most cases the application provides a login form with certain credentials to verify a user.

It's necessary to understand:
- authentication as
- authorization as
- a session
- cookies


## What I will use for this introduction

In this example here I will use
- Plain JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express (JS framework)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Yarn (package management)
- Visual Studio Code as editor

for writing the authentication.

For the login mask I will use the awesome [template from w3layouts](https://w3layouts.com/register-login-widget-flat-responsive-widget-template/).

Following dependencies will I use
- body-parser (for parsing incoming requests)
- express (to make the application run)
- [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) (restarting server when changes occur)
- [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) (object data modeling to simplify interactions with MongoDB)
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs) (for hashing and salting passwords)

The tutorial will be structured in:
- User registration (setting up routes and database)
- Sessions and Cookies (connecting them to login routes)
- Creating custom middleware (to improve the performance)

## User registration

I'll start with a basic express starter setup, which simply creates a webserver and serves the static files from the template on the home route. [(see on Github commit)](https://github.com/DDCSLearning/authenticationIntro/commit/97da94b5b6b52c4f2452d92eb0e92a110a97a1f4)

#### Connect to MongoDB

- install [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/)
- install mondodb
- setup up mongod if you haven't [(tutorial)](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html)
- be sure to start nodemon again with the running mongod on localhost!

#### Create a schema

MongoDB is a document database, which stores JSON like objects. The model/schema describes what this objects should contain.

- create a schema according to the [docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) and store it in an own folder
- the schema should describe the fields we have in our form and specify the data it can expect

It should look something like this:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true,
    trim: true
  },
  username: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true,
    trim: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  passwordConf: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  }
});
var User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
module.exports = User;
```

#### Insert data into MongoDB

- add [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware
- create a POST route for sending the data to the server
- store the values of the filled out form and store the data in the db with the schema
- it should look like this:

```javascript
if (req.body.email &&
    req.body.username &&
    req.body.password &&
    req.body.passwordConf) {

    var userData = {
      email: req.body.email,
      username: req.body.username,
      password: req.body.password,
      passwordConf: req.body.passwordConf,
    }

    //use schema.create to insert data into the db
    User.create(userData, function (err, user) {
      if (err) {
        return next(err)
      } else {
        return res.redirect('/profile');
      }
    });

```

- use the [mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/) to see if your data has been saved to the database (it should show a document in `db.users.find()` )

#### Hashing and salting

**Cryptographic** hash functions take a piece of information and return a string, representing this information. Hash values cannot easily be "unhashed" or decrypted and that's why they are a perfect fit for passwords.

**Salt values** are random data that is included with the input for the hash function.

In this tutorial we are using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs).
