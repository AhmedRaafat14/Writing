Authentication is an important issue when creating a dynamic web application. This article should clear things up and provide a basic instruction.

## Authentication?

Authentication is for identifying users and provide different access rights and content depending on their id.
In most cases the application provides a login form with certain credentials to verify a user.

It's necessary to understand:
- authentication as
- authorization as
- a session
- cookies


## What I will use for this introduction

In this example here I will use
- Plain JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express (JS framework)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Yarn (package management)
- Visual Studio Code as editor

for writing the authentication.

For the login mask I will use the awesome [template from w3layouts](https://w3layouts.com/proficient-login-form-flat-responsive-widget-template/).

Following dependencies will I use
- body-parser (for parsing incoming requests)
- express (to make the application run)
- [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) (restarting server when changes occur)
- [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) (object data modeling to simplify interactions with MongoDB)

The tutorial will be structured in:
- User registration (setting up routes and database)
- Sessions and Cookies (connecting them to login routes)
- Creating custom middleware (to improve the performance)

## User registration

I'll start with a basic express starter setup, which simply creates a webserver and serves the static files from the template on the home route. [(see on Github commit)](https://github.com/DDCSLearning/authenticationIntro/commit/97da94b5b6b52c4f2452d92eb0e92a110a97a1f4)

#### Connect to MongoDB

- install [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/)
- install mondodb
- setup up mongod if you haven't [(tutorial)](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html)
- be sure to start nodemon again with the running mongod on localhost!

#### Create a schema

MongoDB is a document database, which stores JSON like objects. The model/schema describes what this objects should contain.

- create a schema according to the [docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) and store it in an own folder
- the schema should describe the fields we have in our form and specify the data it can expect

It should look something like this:

```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: {
    type: String,
    unique: true,
    required: true,
    trim: true
  },
  password: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  }
});
var User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);
module.exports = User;
```
