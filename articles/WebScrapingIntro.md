From the point I started to learn about web development I was enthusiastic about web crawling or web scraping. Going through the web and using it's content for your ideas seems like an awesome idea to me. That's why I demonstrate the basics with an easy example.

## 1. Frameworks and libraries

In the [tutorial "Scraping the web with Node.js" ](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js) by Scotch.io following frameworks are used to simple traverse a film review website:

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS: minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework with features for web and mobile applications
- Request: Helps making HTTP calls
- Cheerio: Implementation of core jQuery specifically for the server (helps to traverse the DOM and extract data)

That's a very good example of how easy it actually can get. I also list these, because they are actually the most used ones in the tutorials available.

Francis Kim explained in his [article](https://franciskim.co/promise-based-scraper-in-node-js/) how he scraped an certification website and automatically renders out an up-to-date list of developers. He uses promises and mongodb. It's amazing how he  turns a callback based MongoDB native Node.js driver into a promise based one. Definitely check it out.

Andrew Forth shows an alternative approach in his [article](https://www.sitepoint.com/web-crawling-node-phantomjs-horseman/). He combines Node.js with Phantom.js and Horseman. Node is able to use the headless WebKit PhantomJS with the Horseman API. He created a CLI micro-framework that crawls your github repositories as an example.
