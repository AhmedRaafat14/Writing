From the point I started to learn about web development I was enthusiastic about web crawling or web scraping. Going through the web and using it's content for your ideas seems like an awesome idea to me. That's why I demonstrate the basics with an easy example.

## 1. Frameworks and libraries

In the [tutorial "Scraping the web with Node.js" ](https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js) by Scotch.io following frameworks are used to simple traverse a film review website:

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS: minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework with features for web and mobile applications
- Request: Helps making HTTP calls
- Cheerio: Implementation of core jQuery specifically for the server (helps to traverse the DOM and extract data)

That's a very good example of how easy it actually can get.
