## 1. Before writing code

Think about what you want to achieve in your app.
As always [think in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)! Have an idea how your app is structured with components. Also decide which components have a presentational function (mainly for presenting data) and which have a container function (providing data and behavior). Check [Dan Abramov's article](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.24ud80eei) for more.
