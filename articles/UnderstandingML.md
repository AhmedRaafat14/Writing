## What is Machine Learning (ML)

ML finds patterns in data and uses them to predict the future.

Learning requires:
- identifying patterns
- recognizing those patterns

Now it's easy to find patterns. But it is not easy to find patterns that are correct. Increasing the size of data allows to predict outcome that is more and more correct.

|Data|Algorithm|Model|Application|
|-|-|-|-|
|contains patterns|finds patterns|recognizes patterns|uses to recognition on other data|

Typical languages used for ML are:
- R
- Python

## The learning process

#### 1. Asking questions

- what questions to ask 
- what data helps you to answer the question
- how do you measure success

#### 2. Iterate

- select and prepare your data over and over to make it useable for the algorithm
- apply an algorithm on the data and create models over and over to increase your success rate
- change successful models to different data

## ML concepts 

- supervised learning (the value you want to predict is already in the data)
- unsupervised learning (the value you want to predict is not in the data)

#### Data preprocessing with supervised learning

Raw data has to be transformed in to training data by removing unnecessary items like duplicates, wrong/false information, useless information. 

The training data contains features, which stand for important classifications and target values, which stand for the desired piece of information for the model.
