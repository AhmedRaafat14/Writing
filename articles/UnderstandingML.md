## What is Machine Learning (ML)

ML finds patterns in data and uses them to predict the future.

Learning requires:
- identifying patterns
- recognizing those patterns

Now it's easy to find patterns. But it is not easy to find patterns that are correct. Increasing the size of data allows to predict outcome that is more and more correct.

|Data|Algorithm|Model|Application|
|-|-|-|-|
|contains patterns|finds patterns|recognizes patterns|uses to recognition on other data|

Typical languages used for ML are:
- R
- Python

## The learning process

### 1. Asking questions

- what questions to ask 
- what data helps you to answer the question
- how do you measure success
