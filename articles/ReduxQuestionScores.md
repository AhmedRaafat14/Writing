I will build a small application for simply rating questions. This is designed as an exercise project for React and Redux, since I am still not understanding it.

## Motivation for this article

Another small application to understand Redux and React. It feels like it's the 100th app trying to grasp Redux. But 1 month without Redux and you start at basically nothing again. I am like: "Yeah I have heard about that" - and that's it. Action, Action Creators, Reducers, Dispatch, blabla. Too many things to understand :D
