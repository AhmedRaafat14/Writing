Once again I was working on an app from the [FreeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/chart-the-stock-market). In this article you can read the full documentation on the building process.

## The challenge 

See the full challange [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/chart-the-stock-market).

The user stories are pretty simple:

- I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
- I can remove stocks.
- I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

## Roadmap

I learned from [my last full-stack app](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/Writing/blob/master/articles/LearningsFirstFullStack.md) that starting with the backend can induce some issues when you are working on the frontend later on. Therefore this time I will start with the frontend and finish with the backend.

1. Setup the environment with create-react-app
2. Lay out the basic React component structure
3. Set up the Redux eco system
4. Work over all components, divide them into container components and wire everything up with the Redux store
5. Build the Chart component with React-Vis
6. Build the backend using socket.io
7. Deploy to Heroku

## Frontend

I will only highlight the
