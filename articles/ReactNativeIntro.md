## 1. Comparing ReactJS and React Native

To sum up Alexis Mangins great [article on comparing ReactJS and React Native](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/from-reactjs-to-react-native-what-are-the-main-differences-between-both-d6e8e88ebf24#.cv0kqhbe2):
- ReactJS is a JS library and React Native is a framework
- ReactJS uses a bundler, React Native uses Android Studio/XCode
- React-Native doesn’t use HTML to render the app, but provides alternative components that work in a similar way
- Animations in React Native are done with its own API and gestures play an important role, in ReactJS simple CSS animations have been sufficient
- Navigation in ReactJS was easily done with react-router, React Native has it's own API
- Most common used platforms in React Native are Android and iOS. Since each has their own guidelines, development considerations have to be done independently
- Development tools in React Native are similar to ReactJS, however the DOM inspector in Native isn't that good
- Publishing to the app stores with React Native requires to know their guidelines



## 2. Main features of React Native

The homepage states:
1. Build Native Mobile Apps using JavaScript and React
1. A React Native App is a Real Mobile App
