Without a doubt the internet changed the way business is conducted. Selling products and services can easily be scaled, promoted and realized through your own interactive webpage. For full stack developers it's another way of bringing additional value to the market. I love the idea of selling things so easily - that's why I wanted to take a look at it

Now there are literally hundreds of possibilities to create your own web shop.

A basic distinction can be:
- Hosted ecommerce software (more user-friendly)
- Self-hosted open source ecommerce software (more advanced)

## Hosted E-Commerce Software

Hosted ecommerce software doesn't need your technical understanding at all. There a fixed features you can use and combine to build your store. The user experience is mostly designed for simple drag and drop. It is a fast setup but not really flexible to your personal wishes.

#### Shopify

The most famous one is [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/).

They provide
- Over hundreds of professional themes
- Lots of apps to extend the functionality of your store
- 24/7 support
- Experts for additional features for your shop

They provide different pricing models depending on your desired size, scalability and features.

#### BigCommerce

[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/) is the biggest competitor to Shopify and provides pretty similar features. BigCommerce provides more features in the basic version than Shopify and adds some specialized features for promotion in certain "sales channels". Due to the fact that Shopify is so large and well-known it provides a little less options overall in my opinion. Nevertheless they provide a lot and should definitely be considered when building your own web store.
