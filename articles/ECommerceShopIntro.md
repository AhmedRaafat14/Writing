Now there are literally hundreds of possibilities to create your own web shop.

A basic distinction can be:
- Hosted ecommerce software (more user-friendly)
- Self-hosted open source ecommerce software (more advanced)

## Hosted E-Commerce Software

Hosted ecommerce software doesn't need your technical understanding at all. There a fixed features you can use and combine to build your store. The user experience is mostly designed for simple drag and drop. It is a fast setup but not really flexible to your personal wishes.

They provide
- Over hundreds of professional themes
- Lots of apps to extend the functionality of your store
- 24/7 support
