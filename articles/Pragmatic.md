I like to give myself the illusion that I handle many things in a "pragmatic" way. I like the concept. Therefore I dive into pragmatic concepts in programming.

This is a summary of the conclusions from ["The Pragmatic Programmer", by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas](https://www.amazon.de/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505644110&sr=8-1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer).
