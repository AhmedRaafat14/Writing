I like to give myself the illusion that I handle many things in a "pragmatic" way. I like the concept. Therefore I dive into pragmatic concepts in programming.

This is a summary of the conclusions from ["The Pragmatic Programmer", by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas](https://www.amazon.de/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1505644110&sr=8-1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer) added with some of my thoughts.

## Intro

There are already many summaries of this book. But the concepts are important and worth repeating. At the end you will find a list with other summaries, in case you want other opinions as well.

## Content

The book divides itself into the following:

1. the pragmatic philosophy
1. the pragmatic approach
1. the basic tools
1. pragmatic paranoia
1. bend or break
1. while you are coding
1. before a project
1. pragmatic projects

## Pragmatic Philosophy

Before going into it's concepts I would like to revisit it's [definition and quote Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism):

> Pragmatism considers thought an instrument or tool for prediction, problem solving and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes.

In the first chapter of the book general concepts and approaches are described.

- enjoy what you are doing
- find solutions instead of excuses
- fix problems where they occur and work on the source and not the result
- zoom out to the big picture and welcome changes
- set up a quality standard. Follow it.
- knowledge is power. Learn everyday as much as you can. diversify.
- communicate efficiently. Know your stuff and know your audience

## Pragmatic Approach

Now the authors focus more on the development area.


Always stay as DRY as possible (Don't repeat yourself). Avoid duplicating code, information or documentation. Every piece of knowledge should be a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

Follow the principle of [orthogonality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality_(programming)). Set a small set of primitive constructs, that can be combined in a small number of ways. It allows to:
- reduce the numbers of errors
- divide functions within an application easier
- divide teams more logical
- test faster

Use tracer bullets and prototyping to evaluate an environment and adapt it's tools accordingly. Whereas tracer bullets (can be algorithms, techniques, languages, or libraries) should penetrate a bigger area, prototyping provides great feedback when exploring a more focused are of the project (can be new features in an existing system, contents of external data/tools, user interface design). 

> Shoot tracer bullets to explore, prototype to learn!


## Basic tools

Regarding tools stick to powerful basics. 
Use GUIs wisely. They might be easier to start with but are limited. Plain text is always on top in terms of speed and opportunity.
Choose one editor that covers the basics (configurable, extensible, syntax highlighting, etc.) and always use source/version control.

For debugging:
- focus on solving, rather than blaming
- dive to the root of the problem and don't use quick fixes
- find the root by elimination
- try to reproduce the bug (identify the core problem)
- use rubber ducking (explain the bug to someone)

Aim to write code, that writes code (for example uses JSX).

## Pragmatic Paranoia

Don't overestimate yourself. Nobody alone writes perfect code. 
Create assertions where they are absolutely necessary. Exceptions should only be used for exceptional problems.

## Bend or Break
