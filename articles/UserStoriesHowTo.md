User stories are the connection between users and developers. They close the gap between human understanding and engineering. There are many articles on how to write User Stories, but none of them gave a useable practical guide. Therefore, I try to create my own.

## 1. What is a User Story?

In short, User Stories are a description of the software functionality from the perspective of a user.

## 2. Why is it valueable input in project management?

## 3. How do I write a good User Story

#### More People
For writing a good User Story it is an necessity for the writer to see things from the perspective of a actual user. This can be hard when you have already been working on the project and even wrote some code yourself.

Try to get many different people to write User Stories, since each has a different view on the functionality aspect. The more input you have the better your project will be covered and in the end provide a result in the first result that is capable to fit a broad audience.

#### Keep it simple and stupid (KISS)

Depending from which field you're coming, you tend to use jargon. That can lead to misunderstanding and slows down the processes of the project. The goal is to use as simple language as possible. Depending on the context language is interpreted differently. Be sure to stay neutral and to the point.

The component approach that is used in programming, can be used in this context as well. Try to write the User Story as small as possible. User Stories already fit in the bigger project management context - let them be small. 
They can be used like a checklist for the development team.
