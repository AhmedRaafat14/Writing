For writing a good User Story it is an necessity for the writer to see things from the perspective of a actual user. This can be hard when you have already been working on the project and even wrote some code yourself.

Try to get many different people to write User Stories, since each has a different view on the functionality aspect. The more input you have the better your project will be covered and in the end provide a result in the first result that is capable to fit a broad audience.
