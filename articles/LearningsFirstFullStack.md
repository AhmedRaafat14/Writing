The [FreeCodeCamp Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app) qualifies the voting app as advanced backend challenge. However I didn't really understand that qualification, since all user stories pointing to a full stack app. Here are some of my findings of tackeling this app. This can be especially revealing for code beginners, that are on the same path.

## A little background

Seeing the achieved certificates at the FreeCodeCamp about page, I understood it must be hard to accomplish it.

In short this curriculum (and it will be renewed in near future) requires for the first advanced backend challenge practically a full stack app. 

I completely starte from the 0, so this was a real challenge. That's why I also decided to track a little bit and describe some things for other students that encounter the same frustrations on this challenge that I did.

## Some data

Before describing my key learnings I want to provide some data.

I gathered the data with [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/i/cfaa854f-8e87-484b-9023-b8ba1d660e85), which can easily be integrated in your editor and tracks your time you spend on Repos. 

Unfortunately I have discovered it pretty late, in May actually, which leads to a very undertracked result. 

Looking on [Github](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/graphs/contributors) I was already starting with that project in December 2016.

So keep in mind that even the data I am showing doesn't come close to my real efforts.

### Now the numbers:

- I was spending around 120 hours on this app.
- Most of it (13hours) was spent creating the routes file. Basically implementing the REST API.
- Second place with 12 hours spent, was the NewPoll.js file. This was due to the efforts integrating a new poll in the React & Redux eco system, which lead to 3rd place.
- With 12 hours on the ducks for Redux. The ducks file contains most code related to Redux, ie. ActionCreators, Actions, Reducers. Immutable state and asynchronous actions cost so much time to understand and implement correctly.

[See the WakaTime results yourself.](https://wakatime.com/@cfaa854f-8e87-484b-9023-b8ba1d660e85/projects/uleadaknfi?start=2016-11-01&end=2017-08-16)

Again, especially for beginners of interest, my overall time spend coding from May till now (mid August):

- I spend somewhere around 240 hours coding in that timeframe
- most of it in JavaScript 
- most of it using Visual Studio Code
- on an average of 2 hours per week
