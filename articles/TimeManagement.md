Currently I am a business law student in a master program, work more than 20 hours as an employee, organize a non-profit organization, write articles regularly and learn about data science. In order to be successful in all those areas it's very important to enforce a tight schedule and always make decisions in line with my priorities. 

This is also designed as an overview for all my friends and family, since they often feel neglected and I got asked many times.

## Trying to optimize

This is always the most important step. Try to optimize as early and often as possible. There is no optimal solution for time management because your day and routines are always changing and evolving.

Routines are the key for any success. Therefore I try to get into a routine and then keep improving it until I am at a sufficient level.
