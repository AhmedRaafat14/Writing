Currently I am a business law student in a master program, work more than 20 hours as an employee, organize a non-profit organization, write articles regularly and learn about data science. In order to be successful in all those areas it's very important to enforce a tight schedule and always make decisions in line with my priorities. 

This is also designed as an overview for all my friends and family, since they often feel neglected and I got asked many times.

## Trying to optimize

This is always the most important step. Try to optimize as early and often as possible. There is no optimal solution for time management because your day and routines are always changing and evolving.

Routines are the key for any success. Therefore I try to get into a routine and then keep improving it until I am at an efficient level. 

Note that this is subjective. Your improvements have to work for you and not someone else. Hence take time to revisit your progress and past experience.


## Some practical tips

### Work

I want to start with work because most people are dependent on income and therefore naturally have to weigh work as very important. 

It is key to know your worth in the company you are working in. Identify your core value for the firm and build around it. 
In case you are a software developer, focus on your code. Are you a project manager? Focus on the process around projects. It's nice to provide additional value for the company, but always make sure your core competence is covered.

Again, try to optimize as much as possible. When you are faster and better in you job chances are high your employer likes your changes. Try to improve all the time. Revisit past process, change and build up from it.

### University

For me university is additional knowledge. Unfortunately in Austria many universities require physical attendance, which is often good for your learnings, but can be too much if you have many other things to do. Therefore I invest more time at the start of a semester to plan everything accordingly.

1. check all social platforms for summaries of classes
1. download everything and organize with folders
1. attend all first classes to get an overview of the course and what is necessary to get the most out of it
1. 80/20 pareto principle - I learn only what's necessary for the course. 

As a practical example this can be to merely being physically present in each class but working on other things. P Preparing only for the exam is most of the time sufficient. I stick to basic literature with principles. All in-depth books are great but not necessary to get through a course.


### Private Learning

### Sport

### Social Life
