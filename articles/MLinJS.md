[![githubLogo](../assets/GithubLogo/PNG/logo.png)](https://github.com/junku901/machine_learning) [On Github](https://github.com/junku901/machine_learning)

Covered features:

- Logistic Regression
- MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- KNN (K-nearest neighbors)
- K-means clustering
- 3 Optimization Algorithms (Hill-Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic - Algorithm)
- Decision Tree
- NMF (non-negative matrix factorization)

It also offers an incredible browser demo here: http://joonku.com/project/machine_learning

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be maintained :( 

However, great job!

## Convnetjs by karpathy

[![githubLogo](../assets/GithubLogo/PNG/logo.png)](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs) [On Github](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs)

Covered features:
- Common Neural Network modules (fully connected layers, non-linearities)
- Classification (SVM/Softmax) and Regression (L2) cost functions
- Ability to specify and train Convolutional Networks that process images
- An experimental Reinforcement Learning module, based on Deep Q Learning

It also offers an incredible browser demo here: http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/index.html

Unfortunately it is not maintained :( 
But nevertheless a great package for learning and playing around.
