>"There is no quick cure. The hard work matters and the patience is what overrides it." - Gary Vaynerchuk

---

#### Clouds and Dirt

He talks about the importance of have a clear big goal in mind always push to the edges (clouds and dirt) to receive it.

#### Starting out

Be thankful for the opportunities you have. Donâ€™t try to convince people, who donâ€™t like your product. Focus on the ones that already do. For the start you have to grind hard. Always deliver a lot of high quality content. For finding partners be self aware and choose someone that compliments your weaknesses. Donâ€™t listen to excuses when it comes to investing in you. When they believe in you, they support you.

#### Education

Most things in life are taught in the school of life and not university. â€žDonâ€™t be student, be a practitionerâ€œ. The goal in business life should be to find your passion and spending your time realizing it. The willingness to take risks and try new things determine your success.

#### Family Business

Be emotional with people, but stay focused and rational with business.

#### Parenting

Lead by example.

#### Hustle

Is working hard and smart. Build yourself a lot of knowledge and experience, because people can tell if youâ€™re faking it. Donâ€™t listen to general assumptions of working hard. - Give in all that you have. Donâ€™t focus on the business itself, but on the bigger picture to stay healthy. Let your passion drive you. Be a 100% at work when at work and 100% at home when at home.

#### Content and Context

The quality of your brand is determined by the quality of your content. For social media: Respect the platforms and its audience. Length doesnâ€™t matter, but heart, message and fun does. Never abandon a platform entirely. Itâ€™s all about depth not width. Pinterest is becoming a search engine in visual form. Never generate content or fake human interaction. For posts: Find a balance between the art and science (automation). Bet on your strengths instead of working on your weaknesses. Figure out whom youâ€™re trying to sell to, and storytell on the platform you love.

#### Jabs and right Hooks

Jabs build a relationship with your audience, whereas a hook brings in the sale. Donâ€™t have expectations - The absence of pressure and obligation makes people want to reciprocate. Communicate your Jabs and Hooks clearly! Always seek feedback directly through asking. Sell what is most important to the audience, sometimes they need your time to interact with them. Always start with emotion (heart), convince with brain and get paid afterwards.

#### The Platforms

Keys for success: 1.Win the youth and 2. be extraordinarily useful. Better to risk to be an early mover in a new platform and fail, than to not try it at all. Donâ€™t be scared to innovate and try new things - thatâ€™s the rule for todayâ€™s marketing. Facebook Ads are extremely valuable right now. Focus on how much attention a user is paying to a platform. - Instagram has an extremely high attention level of consumers and therefore has a larger network than twitter. The trend is going to smart tech and Internet of things. - Interacting not only with your phone but day-to-day goods. Always use a mix of platforms and always adjust accordingly to trends to get success.

#### Facebook Ads

At the moment these ads give the highest ROI possible. Get in there and figure out what's the best option for you and analyze.

#### Influencer Marketing

The 2 biggest opportunities are product and retail. Everybody is an influencer, everyone counts.- Itâ€™s all about depth not width! Always let influencers do their thing. They know what they are doing and they are good at it. To become an influencer you have to have talent and put in the work.

#### Gratitude

Since being CEO or an entrepreneur in general can be a very lonely job, gratitude is necessary in day-to-day life. Listen a lot and be thankful for everything. Expressing gratitude can be the only thing you can give and it will be enough.

#### Leadership

The DNA stems from the top. It ensures that the values, beliefs and attitudes shape the culture to a productive, innovative, creative and happy environment. Most important advice: You word is bond! Complaining fixes nothing, only action does. To stay motivated yourself, love what you do and be grateful every single day. Hire people who add a different skillset to your company and your skills. A good company culture builds on trust and openness. Itâ€™s important to celebrate wins in the company. - Make sure to smell the roses from time to time, but sometimes you need to hand them out, too. Being nice to people is choice. Itâ€™s independent of your busy schedule.
>Money and fame doesnâ€™t change people, it exposes them.

#### Management

The happiness of your employees has to be more important than of your clients. For hiring: Find outstanding people of their fields in forums/twitter/etc, write them if they are open for a position, interview five and hire one. Hiring and firing are very important and emotional aspects of the company. Keep in mind that you are always dealing with human beings and think of other options before letting them go. When hiring creatives, make sure they know the business aspect as well. Keep meetings very short. - So it will be necessary to be well prepared. For interacting with employees very open and clear, communication is key at all times. Let creatives be successful and do their own things, donâ€™t suppress them. Delegate according to the 80/20 principle and when good enough actually is enough. Let people do things their way and encourage everyone to be an innovator.

#### Investing

Itâ€™s important that the idea is phenomenal, but also the founders know what they do. And ask yourself â€žHow would that person in a crisis handle those things?â€œ. Invest in areas in which you have intuitive strength or your interest matches your knowledge. It seems obvious, but the founders and VCs should always have a conversation about their expectations. Be aware that  as company grow larger the requirement for the management changes as well!

#### Self-Awareness

The best and easiest way to get to know your strengths and weaknesses is just asking people. Make sure to have a good portion of humor as your personal traits, itâ€™s one of the most important but also one of the rarest. Focus on your goals while betting your strengths is most important. Execution matters. Whether you are a shy nerd or an open entertainer. To keep self-confidence high, dream big and stop worrying about the little things. Always try to make others happy, but also look out for yourself. For sales, connections, references - just ask.

#### Public Speaking

Be yourself and punch people in the face with content and emotions.

#### The last chapters contain

Think about your legacy and live on the offense. 
Donâ€™t be afraid to show your emotions and go for what you want.
Life is about the climb.
Care about your health.
