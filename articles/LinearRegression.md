Linear regression is one of the first concepts you have to get your head around when you start with machine learning. In a simple linear regression, scores are predicted on one variable from the scores on a second variable. Very simple and powerful. Here I implemented the concept with React and visualized it with React-vis. Enjoy

## On logistic regression 

> Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.

## Used data

Here I have used public available data from Austria. In this example marriages of all people living in Salzburg (a city in Austria) are gathered over time. It allows to show differences in age, years, wifes or husbands.
