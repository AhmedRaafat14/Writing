During my web development learning experience I came stumbled very often over Amazon Web Services but never really understood what it's capabilities are. The following article contains the things I have learned from my research.

If you want to start learning more about AWS check out my provided links at the end. Unfortunately there is a lot of outdated or simple badly explained content on the web. Be sure to consolidate a good resource.

## What is AWS?
As Amazon explains in their [documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/gsg-aws-intro.html):
>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides on-demand computing resources and services in the cloud, with pay-as-you-go pricing. For example, you can run a server on AWS that you can log on to, configure, secure, and run just as you would a server that's sitting in front of you.

The whole concept builds on top of the cloud computing principle. It provides IT infrastructure and other services over the internet.

And it's commonly used for:
>- Store public or private data.
>- Host a static website. These websites use client-side technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to display content that doesn't change frequently. A static website doesn't require server-side technologies (such as PHP and ASP.NET).
>- Host a dynamic website, or web app. These websites include classic three-tier applications, with web, application, and database tiers.
>- Support students or online training programs.
>- Process business and scientific data.
>- Handle peak loads.

## AWS Products

The following categories represent the core products of AWS.

#### Compute and Networking Services [[Details]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/gsg-aws-compute-network.html#compute-network-concepts)

This section contains services and their structure.

- Amazon EC2
Provides virtual servers in the AWS cloud.

- Amazon VPC
Provides an isolated virtual network for your virtual servers.

- Elastic Load Balancing
Distributes network traffic across your set of virtual servers.

- Auto Scaling
Automatically scales your set of virtual servers based on changes in demand.

- Amazon Route 53
Routes traffic to your domain name to a resource, such as a virtual server or a load balancer.

- AWS Lambda
Runs your code on virtual servers from Amazon EC2 in response to events.

- Amazon ECS
Provides Docker containers on virtual servers from Amazon EC2.


#### Storage and Content Delivery Services
#### Security and Identity Services
#### Database Services
#### Analytics Services
#### Application Services
#### Management Tools



## How do I use it?

AWS can be accessed through:
- AWS Management Console
- AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
- Command Line Tools
- AWS Software Development Kits (SDK)
- Query APIs

There is a detailed guide on how to install and use each of these options in the documentation.

As you can see it takes a while to get familiar with each tool to get into some sort of workflow.

## A variety of services
## A global infrastructure
Low costs
Deployment and management
Content delivery CloudFront

## Security

## Example App
- Load balancer tier (eg Elastic Load Balancing)
- Web/app tier (eg EC2 AutoScaling Group)
- Caching tier (eg ElastiCache for Memcached)
- Database tier (eg Multi-AZ RDS)
- Static content (eg Amazon S3)
- Content Delivery (with Amazon CloudFront)
