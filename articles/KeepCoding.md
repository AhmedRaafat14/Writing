## I started a year ago

Exactly 1 year ago I decided to quit my job and started to learn to code. I knew that it was right. I never looked back. The start was easy. A lot of motivation and endless ideas. So far it was a great experience just to realize what it means to pursue a dream on the side. Studying, working and just being exposed to all the great things this world has to offer makes it freakin' hard. What I've learned so far:

## Be prepared to give up a lot of things

>"Sacrifice who you are for what you will become" - Eric Thomas

Boy I had no idea what that meant. But I sure do now. Read it again. Ask yourself what it means for your life.

I can tell you what it meant for me:
It sure is a lonely road. When you are working 20 or 40 hours a week. Still studying, having a relationship, a family or contributing regularly to a community, you will have "no time". You are exhausted and want to relax. Your body wants everything except doing what's necessary to achieve your goal. 

Ask yourself: When you come home after an 8 hour day, are you sitting down and start working on that dream of yours? No? Why not? Is it a thing or just an excuse? Most of the time it's an excuse.

>"Success is a very, very lonely road. Very few people are willing to make the sacrifices and take the pain to be successful. It’s an uphill battle and along that road, you’re not going to see too many friends. You’re going to see your shadow most often. You gotta trust in the heart of hearts – inside that what you’re doing, what you believe in is a worthy cause and a winnable fight. See, the thing is for many people – they’ve tried the same path that you’re on and they failed. As you walk this journey you’re going to see carcasses of people that walked this place. People that didn’t quite have it… And that should inspire you because you got further than that person and that person. But you’re not looking to get further than them, you’re looking to finish." -Greg Plitt
