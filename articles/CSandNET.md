# Start with C# and .NET

Coming from a javascript world I have to get familiar with C# and it's .NET environment. Since the gap between those 2 languages seems huge to me, I decided to write a short introduction.

## What is C#?
Microsoft define it themselves:
>C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework. You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much, much more. Visual C# provides an advanced code editor, convenient user interface designers, integrated debugger, and many other tools to make it easier to develop applications based on the C# language and the .NET Framework.

C# syntax provides some features like:
- nullable value types ( types, to which you can assign normal range of values as well as null values)
- enumerations (a special sets of named values which all maps to a set of numbers)
- delegates (a reference type variable that holds the reference to a method)
- lambda expressions (an anonymous function that you can use to create delegates or expression tree types)
- direct memory access#



## 2. Notes on some C# keywords

#### Syntax
C# is an **object-oriented language**, which means that a program consists of various objects that interact with each other by means of actions.
Actions that are used by objects are called **methods**. Objects of the same kind are said to be in the same **class**.
A simple program includes namespaces and classes, which are in it's widest sense objects that interact with each other.

#### Data types
These types are categorized into:
- Value types, whom can be assigned a value directly
- Reference types, that store a reference like objects, dynamics or strings
- Pointer types, which store the memory address of another type

#### Type conversion
Is converting one type of data to another type (also known as Type Casting). In C#, type casting can be implicit or explicit. Whereas explicit type conversion is done by using a pre-defined function, implicit type conversion relies on using the same type environment (e.g. from smaller to larger integral types).

#### Variables, constants and operators
These don't really differ much from other languages. In C# they are categorized into different types. There is a lot content on the internet with a full list of types [(example)](http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/C_Sharp_Variables_and_Constants#C.23_Integer_Variable_Types).

A variable is a name for a storage area that the program can manipulate.

Constants are treated like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.

An operator tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.

#### Decision making, loops and encapsulation
If else statements and for and while loops are pretty much the same as in other languages.

The object-oriented principle of Encapsulation helps avoid duplicate relationships between information, allowing you to hide internal state and abstract access to it though type members such as methods, properties, and indexers.
>Encapsulation helps you reduce coupling between objects and increases the maintainability of your code.

#### Arrays and strings
An array stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type stored at contiguous memory locations.

Strings are an array of characters. Most of time the string keyword is used to declare a string variable - it's an alias for the System.String class.

#### Structures and classes

Microsoft provides an excellent [definition of structs and classes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173109.aspx):

>A class is a reference type. When an object of the class is created, the variable to which the object is assigned holds only a reference to that memory. When the object reference is assigned to a new variable, the new variable refers to the original object. Changes made through one variable are reflected in the other variable because they both refer to the same data.

>A struct is a value type. When a struct is created, the variable to which the struct is assigned holds the struct's actual data. When the struct is assigned to a new variable, it is copied. The new variable and the original variable therefore contain two separate copies of the same data. Changes made to one copy do not affect the other copy.

>In general, classes are used to model more complex behavior, or data that is intended to be modified after a class object is created. Structs are best suited for small data structures that contain primarily data that is not intended to be modified after the struct is created.
