## Intro

### Challenges in NLP

- Tokenization (breaking text into smaller pieces)
- Stopword Removal (Filtering non-important words)
- N-Grams (Grouping related words)
- Word Sense Disambiguation (Identifying the context in which the word occurs)
- Parts-of-Speech (Identifying characteristics of a language)
- Stemming (Removing endings of words)

### Machine Learning Workflow

1. Pick a problem
1. Represent data using numeric attributes
1. Use an algorithm to find a model


## Auto summarizing texts

### Method Abstract Extraction

- find the most important words (important words are generally more often repeated)
- calculate a score for sentences containing important words 
- select import sentences

## Classify text with machine learning

To use machine learning we need to identify a problem. In this case we want 


### Classification
To apply any machine learning we need data. The data will be a set of articles. In those articles a certain theme will be identified. Those themes will be assigned to the new articles.
