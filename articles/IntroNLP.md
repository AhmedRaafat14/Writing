Natural Language Processing focuses on making the human language available for the computer and allowing it to optimize it's use. As a law student I have to work through thousands pages of court rulings and really like to have a tool that helps me simplify all those texts. NLP is one way to do that. This article provides a general overview about this topic.

## Starting in NLP

The starting point for NLP is a (large) text. 
The computer can't understand text like we humans do, therefore we need to break the text into it's meaningful parts.
That's called tokenization and provides the foundation for re-combining them in to new sentences.

Linguistic analysis:
- syntax (grammer, spelling)
- semantics (identifying the meaning of a text)
- pragmatics (purpose of a text)
