## Start

Treehouse encourage you to start with the 4 P's of Problem Solving:

- Preperation
- Plan
- Perform
- Perfect


I read about this solving strategy multiple times and like the approach when tackling building applications.

## Prepare

Problem:
We want to look at a user's badge count and his points in JavaScript.

Solution:
Using Node.js to look up profiles and get the data via http

## Plan

- Create a web server
- Handle HTTP home route GET and POST
- Handle HTTP rout GET of the username
- Function to read the data and output it in our app

Go through the [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v7.x/docs/api/synopsis.html) to see examples and get help if you're stuck.

## Perform
