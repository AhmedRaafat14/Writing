2017 comes to an end and it's time to reflect on the work I have done regarding the non-profit work. 

As soon as I have learned the basics of programming with the help of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) I was eager to give something back. I figured out, that I probably can do the most when strengthening the local group of the organization, helping individuals, who are on the same path and just provide a framework of exchange for these groups of people.
