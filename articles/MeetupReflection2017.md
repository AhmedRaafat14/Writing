2017 comes to an end and it's time to reflect on the work I have done regarding the non-profit work. 

As soon as I have learned the basics of programming with the help of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) I was eager to give something back. I figured out, that I probably can do the most when strengthening the local group of the organization, helping individuals, who are on the same path and just provide a framework of exchange for these groups of people.

## Short introduction

I connected to the current organizer at this time and immediately started to contribute with everything I thought could be helpful. 

## Why organizing events is great

Managing an organization is one of the most rewarding tasks I believe. Not because of the feedback you receive but rather because of the complexity of the task itself. When organizing meetups and events, one not only must handle event-specific tasks such as preparing locations, sponsors, talks and content, but also stay in contact with all people involved in the process and get yourself into the discussed topics as well. 

The complexity itself demands a lot from the organizer and schools him on many aspects of life. As I see it, it is the perfect preparation for starting a business. 

## A take on non-profit systems and entities

During the journey it seemed necessary to formalize the work through a non-profit entity. 
This decision has to be made after careful due diligence. Setting up a business-like structure involves many new aspects in organizing such as: Correspondence to local authorities, being aware of legal pitfalls (especially regarding tax law and competition law ) and being liable to certain actions. 

It introduces and demands a new field of competence and expertise but also allows for additional rewards. Some of them are: 
- tax exemptions
- free use of various software, products and services
- possibility of official subsidies
- after the setup: way more organized way of handling business-like transactions
