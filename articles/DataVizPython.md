## Python and it's eco system.

- Python as a solid established programming language
- Has many libraries (especially in the field of science and data visualization)
- Matplotlib (data visualization library)
- Pandas (for importing and processing data)
- Jupyter (interactive Python Notebook)
- Anaconda as package manager for Python


## Distribution Data with Histograms

Histograms help you understand the distribution of a numeric value in a way that you cannot with mean or median alone.

## Time Series / Line Charts

- shows trend of over time
- test a hypothesis on a variety of conditions
- reduced misinterpretation of data

## Scatterplots

- show relationships between multiple variables
- helps you find outliners

## Bar graphs

- help compare numeric values
- good for comparing multiple values

## Data Aggregation / sampling

- using mean, percentiles
- evaluating samples multiple times
