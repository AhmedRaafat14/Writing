Ever since I read "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman I was amazed by statistics and all cognitive biases that come along with not understanding statistics. I think it's important to remind yourself from time to time of all the cognitive fallacies that can easily turn your life to the worse. So here is a little summary - enjoy!

## Intro

Two of the most famous people talking about human misjudgment are Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. The Vice Chairman and Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway both have talked about their efforts of overcoming cognitive fallacies in order to make decisions that yield great investments and made them some of the richest men in history. 

## Reward and Punishment Tendency

This behavior is deeply rooted into our past. Humans do more of things that they like and do less of things they don't like. This is very simply, but also very strong. It's so obvious that many people neglect it. 

## Framing - Disliking/Liking Tendency

## Anchoring 

Humans are heavily rely on the first piece of information they get. Sales negotiations evolve around the first price that was made. 
Plausible information is even referenced when there is completely no reason to use it. (Tested in questions about scales).

## Availability Bias

Personally my favorite one. The easier information is to retrieve the more important we qualify it. And emotional experience enhances the effect. 
People that got robbed estimate the probabilities of robberies significantly higher than non-robbed people. Smokers often denial the threat of cancer with a personal example reference of somebody, who did not get cancer and smoked a lot.
