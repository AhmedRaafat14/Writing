What is the secret to achieving goals? how do you put it down you are moving in the right direction? People will be like is it your genetics is it your potential when it comes down to it success has nothing to do with potential. It is all about your perseverance in somebody, that will override any endeavor. If you throw shit against the wall eventually something will stick. You guys who are has potential doesn't have potential that shit dies what lasts forever is the perseverance to always show up thats what champions do. Champions are the same as every ordinary person the only differential is they show up to the event every single day. They see failure as a learning curve and welcome it. You will learn more from failure than you ever could from success. 

So showing up getting knocked on your ass finding the intestinal fortitude to stand back up and face that endeavor is going to be the overriding factor that makes the difference. 

How do you know when you are doing those things? The small things in life add up to those big monumental things. When I say small things I mean they are character building blocks it means your name means something you hold value to your name.

When you drop trash on the ground you pick it back up because it is your responsibility you hold value to yourself. When you shake someones hand you look them in the eye and give them a firm handshake because you are here for a purpose. Everything that you do you do it to the best of your ability. It doesn't matter what you are doing it is the fact that you are doing it so therefore it means something to you. Thats going to build a legacy. 

You know the title out there doesn't mean shit. You win the title fine. That title wont get you another title all your trying to build is a legacy. Footprints in the sand left behind as motivation for someone else to follow your legacy is built daily. Through character the will power the of conduct within someone thats the perseverance of showing up every single day. That will always achieve the goal. It doesn't matter what your born with your potential how much you make a silver spoon all that can be attained if your willing to risk failure for success.
