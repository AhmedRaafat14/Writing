What is the secret to achieving goals? how do you put it down so everyday you know if you are going in the right direction of success? Is it your genetics, is it your potential? 
When it comes down to it, success has nothing to do with potential. It is all about the perseverance in somebody, that will override any endeavor. If you throw shit against the wall eventually something will stick. 

Guys who have this potential or don't have this potential. That shit dies. What continues to last forever is the perseverance to always show up. Thats what champions do. Every single Champion is the same as every ordinary person. The only differential is they show up to the event every single day. They see failure as a learning curve and welcome it. You will learn more from failure than you ever could from success. So showing up getting knocked on your ass finding the intestinal fortitude to stand back up and face that endeavor is going to be the overriding factor that makes the difference. 

How do you know when you are doing those things? The small things in life add up to those big monumental things. When I say small things, I mean the character building blocks that your name means something. You hold value to your name.
When you drop trash on the ground you pick it back up because it is your responsibility you hold value to yourself. When you shake someones hand you look them in the eye and give them a firm handshake because you are here for a purpose. Everything that you do you do it to the best of your ability. It doesn't matter what you are doing. It is the fact that you are doing it, so therefore it means something to you. Thats going to build a legacy. 

You know footprints behind you, that are left motivation for someone to follow. Legacy is build daily. Through the character, willpower, code of conduct within somebody. thats the perseverance of showing up every single day. 

That will always achieve the goal. It doesn't matter what you are born with, your potential, how much of a silver spoon or money you have. All that can be attained if your willing to risk failure for success.
