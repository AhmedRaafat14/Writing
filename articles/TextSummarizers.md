I am a law student and always need to go through huge amounts of text. On my way to learn more natural language processing I came across text summarizing. Here is a list of some online summarizers. Enjoy.

## SMMRY

#### What it does

- Ranking sentences by importance using the core algorithm.
- Reorganizing the summary to focus on a topic; by selection of a keyword.
- Removing transition phrases.
- Removing unnecessary clauses.
- Removing excessive examples.

#### How it works

- Associate words with their grammatical counterparts. (e.g. "city" and "cities")
- Calculate the occurrence of each word in the text.
- Assign each word with points depending on their popularity.
- Detect which periods represent the end of a sentence. (e.g "Mr." does not).
- Split up the text into individual sentences.
- Rank sentences by the sum of their words' points.
- Return X of the most highly ranked sentences in chronological order.

## Autosummarizer

The project is under development according to the homepage. 

As the homepage states: 

>"The project is in development. Summarize your articles, splitting the most important sentences and ranking a sentence based on importance."

I assume that the core algorithm is similar to the one used in [SMMRY](#how-it-works)


## Summarize Tool (tools4noobs)

[Online summarize tool](https://www.tools4noobs.com/summarize/)

This tool is a little bit more sophisticated then the previous systems.
Here you can choose to add additional criteria like:
- Setting a threshold
- Setting a minimum for sentence or word length
- Show most important words and highlight them
- Show most important sentences and highlight them
