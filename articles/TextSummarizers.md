I am a law student and always need to go through huge amounts of text. On my way to learn more natural language processing I came across text summarizing. Here is a list of some online summarizers. Enjoy.

### What it does

- Ranking sentences by importance using the core algorithm.
- Reorganizing the summary to focus on a topic; by selection of a keyword.
- Removing transition phrases.
- Removing unnecessary clauses.
- Removing excessive examples.

### How it works

- Associate words with their grammatical counterparts. (e.g. "city" and "cities")
- Calculate the occurrence of each word in the text.
- Assign each word with points depending on their popularity.
- Detect which periods represent the end of a sentence. (e.g "Mr." does not).
- Split up the text into individual sentences.
- Rank sentences by the sum of their words' points.
- Return X of the most highly ranked sentences in chronological order.
