2017 passed by pretty quickly and so it's even more important to reflect on all the progress that I have made and what could be improved for 2018. 
Enjoy! :)

## My goals for 2017

Most of the time I have a well defined set of goals for the next year. For 2017 Some of those were: 
- Getting a job in programming
- Write 1 article a week
- Giving something back to society with a new non-profit goal
- Keep coding for at least 4 times a week
- Keep studying law at a public university
- Read at least 10 books
- Stay consistent with fitness ( at least 3 times a week)

In the following lines I will examine the progress of each goal in more detail.
