2017 passed by pretty quickly and so it's even more important to reflect on all the progress that I have made and what could be improved for 2018. 
Enjoy! :)

## My goals for 2017

Most of the time I have a well defined set of goals for the next year. For 2017 Some of those were: 
- Getting a job in programming
- Write 1 article a week
- Giving something back to society with a new non-profit goal
- Keep coding for at least 4 times a week
- Keep studying law at a public university
- Read at least 10 books
- Stay consistent with fitness ( at least 3 times a week)

In the following lines I will examine the progress of each goal in more detail.

## Getting a job in programming

This was huge for me. In May 2016 I quite my job in tax advisory to get into programming. Since then I was studying and learning very hard to develop the skill set to work as a developer. 

I worked through the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum and connected with local developers as much as possible. Each day I was watching videos, reading articles, programming small algorithms or attending some programming-related meetups. 

At the end of 2016 I thought I was ready to apply for a job in this field. The great thing was that I was already connected to some programmers in the local community, which acted as a gateway into interviews. 

One important note here: I was only able to connect to local programmers because I was introducing myself as a beginner on events and offering volunteer work to THEIR projects. I did this many times and followed the projects that had a good working flow and learning experience. 

Due to all the work with local people, online presence and some sort of presentation skill I was able to get my first job as a developer pretty quickly in March. 

It was surprising to me how fast this goal could be accomplished.
