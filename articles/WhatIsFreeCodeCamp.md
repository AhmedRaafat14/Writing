Since I'm one of many who learn to code online, I want to share my experiences and thoughts.
I started to learn coding on my own last year and tried many different sources to get the knowledge into my head. I learned on online courses (like Free Code Camp), watched a lot of tutorials on youtube, paid for online courses, read a bunch of books, joined local meetups and started to write own projects. I'm still a very beginner (after 6 months) and everyone has to realize that understanding a programming language takes time.

## 1. What is Free Code Camp üîª
The [homepage](https://www.freecodecamp.com/about/) itself explains quite well what they want to accomplish and provide.
The [FAQ](https://www.freecodecamp.com/about/) also covers a lot.
It says:
> We‚Äôre an open source community that helps you learn to code.

>You can work through our self-paced coding challenges, build projects, and earn certificates. We also connect you with people in your city so you can code together.

So in a nutshell it is another online source for learning to code.

## 2. What's it about? - Cornerstonesüîª

First and foremost it's **free**, which is pretty amazing when you look at the quality they provide.

At the time of writing there are 4 certificates:
#### 1. Front End
- `HTML` & `CSS`
- Frameworks
- Basics of `Javascript`
- Different JS Algorithms (a lot!)
- JSON APIs and AJAX

#### 2. Back End
- `Node` and `Express` as runtime environment
- `GIT` for version control
- `MongoDB` for databases

#### 3. Data Visualization
- Different Projects using foremost `SASS` `React` and `D3`

#### 4. Full Stack Development
- 4 non-profit projects

## 3. Why is it so good?  üîª

#### Real projects
What I really enjoyed was the fact that you can code real working projects with a very big community at your hand.
There are easy chapters with a lot of guidance that allow you to get comfortable with the new syntax and problems. After that you have the opportunity to write something that is actually working. Something that you can present to your friends. Small projects like the [Javascript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator) are absolutely doable and "cool" enough to be presented to non-coding people :)
Because from personal experience, when you tell people you are learning to code, they want to see results. It's pretty hard to present something you created yourself on other learning platforms. In my opinion the gap between guided theoretical coding and real life projects was too big.

#### Community
Free Code Camp itself provides various social media and chatting platforms. But the real value is in the people that learn and provide help for others.
Especially in the beginning I was really delighted that there are so many well documented solutions of different people. It helped a lot to solve problems in different ways and see the opportunities in coding.
It also shows how amazing open source projects can be. The whole platform has hundreds of contributors, who not only bring new content into the project, but also provide solutions for existing bugs and other issues. ([See Github ‚û°Ô∏è](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp))

The [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/c/wiki) also provides great interaction with other people on the same journey as you are.

## 1. What's coming?  üîª
Currently there is a beta version of the new Free Code Camp platform. [Check it out ‚û°Ô∏è.](https://beta.freecodecamp.com/en/map) Unfortunately I didn't find any release date, but when you look at the challenges you see that there is coming a lot. It makes me really excited. In my opinion Free Code Camp brings online learning of web development to another level.
