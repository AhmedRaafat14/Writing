Since I'm one of many who learn to code online, I want to share my experiences and thoughts.
I started to learn coding on my own last year and tried many different sources to get the knowledge into my head. I learned on online courses (like Free Code Camp), watched a lot of tutorials on youtube, paid for online courses, read a bunch of books, joined local meetups and started to write own projects. I'm still a very beginner (after 6 months) and everyone has to realize that understanding a programming language takes time.

## 1. What is Free Code Camp 🔻
The [homepage](https://www.freecodecamp.com/about/) itself explains quite well what they want to accomplish and provide.
The [FAQ](https://www.freecodecamp.com/about/) also covers a lot.
It says:
> We’re an open source community that helps you learn to code.

>You can work through our self-paced coding challenges, build projects, and earn certificates. We also connect you with people in your city so you can code together.

So in a nutshell it is another online source for learning to code.
