[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is `a Jacascript library for building user interfaces`. I'll go into the topic and clarify some features to get the most out of my coding with React.

Covering: ES6 React, virtual DOM, Component-driven development, Immutability, Top-down rendering, , debugging, routing, isomorphic React.

## 1. Components & Props  🔻
>Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

The difference between functional components and class components, is that functional components simply take props and provide a function, whereas a class allows many more features.

It is possible to compose or extract components to achieve the desired functional structure.

### In terms of `props`:

> ❗ All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props. ❗

This means that component is not allowed to modify it's own props.

#### Routing in React
Get familiar with the [react-router API](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/docs/API.md#redirect) since it provides a very easy and sufficient way of routing components on the client-side (but it's also able to render on server-side!)
Check out this great [introduction](https://medium.com/@dabit3/beginner-s-guide-to-react-router-53094349669#.uyatb25eu) if you are not familiar with it.
