## What this article is about

In this article I will describe the process of building the Voting App for the [Free Code Camp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).
For beginners: Be sure to read the documentation of each tool you use properly. There is no shortcut to success. Try, fail and learn. ;)
For everybody: This is no optimized example for building the application. I am open for feedback of any kind. I am still a beginner :)


#### Structure

To break down this application I will divide it into sections for backend, frontend, data visualization and the deployment process. The project will be available as open source code on Github, where you can follow up with commits and the end result.


#### Development Environment

- Plain JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express (JS framework)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Yarn (package management)
- Visual Studio Code as editor
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (testing APIs)


#### Dependencies


## Frontend
## Backend
## Visualization
## Deployment / DevOps
