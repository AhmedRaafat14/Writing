The Voting App on Free Code Camp is in my opinion the first challenge, that was really hard. I just couldn't do it as easy as all the other challenges. Too much knowledge in too much fields is required. Also, I didn't find any tutorials or examples, that broke this challenge down with up-to-date tools. So I decided to document it my building process.

I will use:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React + Redux
- Node.js

also known as "MERN-Stack".

Have fun :)

## What this article is about

In this article I will describe the process of building the Voting App for the [Free Code Camp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).
For beginners: Be sure to read the documentation of each tool you use properly. There is no shortcut to success. Try, fail and learn. ;)
For everybody: This is no optimized example for building the application. I am open for feedback of any kind. I am still a beginner :)


#### Structure

To break down this application I will divide it into sections for backend, frontend, data visualization and the deployment process. The project will be available as open source code on Github, where you can follow up with commits and the end result.


#### Development Environment

- Plain JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express (JS framework)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Yarn (package management)
- Visual Studio Code as editor
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (testing APIs)


#### Packages / Features / Dependencies

General
- ([ES 6](http://es6-features.org/) (JS scripting-language specification))
- [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) with Airbnb extension (for writing higher quality code)
- [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) (restarting server when changes occur)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (javascript compiler)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) (module bundler/builder)

Frontend
- [React]() (JS framework)
- [Redux]() (state management for React)
- [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) (framework for material design)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (React Boilerplate)


Backend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JS runtime environment for server-side)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb) (document based database)


- [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) (for parsing incoming requests)
- [express](http://expressjs.com/de/) (to make the application run)
- [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) (object data modeling to simplify interactions with MongoDB)
- [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) (HTTP request logger middleware)

Visualization

- react vis?
- deck gl?
- D3?
- google charts?

Deployment / DevOps

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (PaaS to run applications in the cloud) ?
- AWS?
- CI Travis
- Terraform?

(Unit)Testing

- Not implemented in this app (but normally it should)
- Manual testing as long as feasible
