The Voting App on Free Code Camp is in my opinion the first challenge, that was really hard. I just couldn't do it as easy as all the other challenges. Too much knowledge in too much fields is required. Also, I didn't find any tutorials or examples, that broke this challenge down with up-to-date tools. So I decided to document it my building process.

I will use:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React + Redux
- Node.js

also known as "MERN-Stack".

Have fun :)

## What this article is about

In this article I will describe the process of building the Voting App for the [Free Code Camp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).
For beginners: Be sure to read the documentation of each tool you use properly. There is no shortcut to success. Try, fail and learn. ;)
For everybody: This is no optimized example for building the application. I am open for feedback of any kind. I am still a beginner :)

___
Always read the documentation to each tool you use!
___


#### Structure

To break down this application I will divide it into sections for backend, frontend, data visualization and the deployment process. The project will be available as open source code on Github, where you can follow up with commits and the end result.


#### Development Environment

- Plain JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express (JS framework)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Yarn (package management)
- Visual Studio Code as editor
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) (testing APIs)


#### Packages / Features / Dependencies

General
- ([ES 6](http://es6-features.org/) (JS scripting-language specification))
- [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) with Airbnb extension (for writing higher quality code)
- [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) (restarting server when changes occur)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (javascript compiler)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) (module bundler/builder)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (for configuring environment variables)


Backend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (JS runtime environment for server-side)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb) (document based database)


- [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) (for parsing incoming requests)
- [express](http://expressjs.com/de/) (to make the application run)
- [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) (object data modeling to simplify interactions with MongoDB)
- [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) (HTTP request logger middleware)

Frontend
- [React]() (JS framework)
- [Redux]() (state management for React)
- [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) (framework for material design)



Visualization

- react vis?
- deck gl?
- D3?
- google charts?

Deployment / DevOps

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (PaaS to run applications in the cloud) ?
- AWS?
- CI Travis
- Terraform?

(Unit)Testing

- Not implemented in this app (but normally it should)
- Manual testing as long as feasible

## First things first

First I will set up my environment:
- add git for version control
- create your package management with yarn init
- add express for a fast web development
- add the nodemon package for restarting your server on changes
- add eslint.rc for your eslint configuration
- add babel and corresponding plugins for compiling JS


As additional integration I'll use:
- Travis CI (for contineous integration)
- Code Climate (for Code quality)
- Assertible (Monitoring Web Services, especially checking deployment  - Quality Assurance)

[Check out my commit on Github after the setup.](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/23a05a550f6e2e34cb182d3a271a4c44028d07f9)

## Backend

I will start with the backend, since it's the most difficult in my opinion.

#### Set up Packages, Middleware and Mongoose

I will use:
- [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) for parsing request bodies
- [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for logging out HTTP requests
- [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) for compressing response bodies
- [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) for setting basic security with HTTP headers
- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) object modeling tool for asynchronous database connection


Next
- create a constants file to set you different environment variables and corresponding settings
- create a middleware file to pass in middleware to your app and differentiate for environments (especially use bodyparser and morgan packages here)
- create a database file to set up the mongoDB connection
- modularize your code and outsource your constants, middleware and database connection for keeping smaller files
- don't forget to import everything in your app.js file, pass in the middleware function and test your setup with a simple http request

[Check out my commit on Github after the setup.](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/88a2436697be4147302ce2dbcd3104ed564c86fe)

#### Set up your routes

Revisit  the User stories and lay out your routes accordingly

Following the [CRUD principle:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)

As an unauthenticated user I want to
- see all polls (R)
- see individual polls (R)
- vote on available polls (C)

As an authenticated user I want to
- see/read all polls (R)
- see individual polls (R)
- vote on available polls (C)
- create new polls (C)
- create new options/votes (C)
- delete polls (D)

Therefore:
- set up [error handling as middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)
- set up your [router object](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router)
- create your GET, POST, DELETE routes and response with json objects
- test the set up routes with postman (all should have a status code of 200)
- connect your routes to your middleware and app.js

#### Set up Mongoose and your Schemas and connect everything to your routes

When setting up Schemas think about how you want to structure you documents that have to be stored in the database. In this example we need to store user for the authentication process and polls with answers.

For polls we need:
- the question
- answers/votes

- create your mongoose schemas and models
- connect to [mlab](https://mlab.com/) to monitor your DB actions better
___
Be aware that mlab creates those "System Collections" that throw "duplicate key error index dup key: { : null }" error in postman, when creating new polls. Till now I didn't find a solution but deleting all collections allows to start again. ;)
___
- use the dotenv package to store your credentials in the environment and add the .env file to .gitignore (if you make your project open source)
- connect you routes with your mongoose model to handle the documents in MongoDB


> BE SURE TO READ THE [DOCS](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) when you are stuck. This part is pretty hard when you haven't done a lot with mongoose and MongoDB!

[Check out my commit on Github after these steps.](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/5dcd7359d2cb1b31e28a08869461b927094550c0)

#### Establish authentication and authorization with Twitter

I want to use the twitter sign-on as an [OAuth](https://oauth.net/) provider to authenticate. It provides better user experience and I also got to explore OAuth.

>OAuth is a standard protocol that allows users to authorize API access to web and desktop or mobile applications. Once access has been granted, the authorized application can utilize the API on behalf of the user.


Of course I found [the great article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-node-authentication-twitter) on how to set up the authentication process in Nodejs. After failing to implement it properly in my app (took me a whole day) I decided to dive straight into the [documentation of passport](http://passportjs.org/docs)!

I love the quote the put up there:

>Despite the complexities involved in authentication, code does not have to be complicated.

___
‚≠ê Again, as a reminder: Read the Documentation!
___

- first register your app on [twitter apps](https://apps.twitter.com/) and get your settings right (access level and the Callback URL have to be determined!)
- add passport, passport-twitter and express-session packages to your application
- create a file defining a passport strategy (twitter)
- to support login session passport has to serialize and deserialize user
- pass passport to your passport cofiguration and connect both `passport.initialize` and `passport.session` to your app as middleware (make sure that the express-session is used before!)
- set up routes for authenticating and the callback


[Check out my commit on Github after these steps.](https://github.com/DDCreationStudios/votingApp/tree/d398cce56b1df2d042c07d2849223e88a5a2ed7f)

After that, connect the authentication process to your database
___
‚≠ê Tip: Use for your callback and testing always `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` instead of `http://localhost:3000/`, since it solves a lot of problems, that might occur using passport-twitter. üòâ
___
- create a mongoose Schema for your users (to track them in your database)
- fill the callback function of your passport.js file when implementing the twitter strategy, with filtering your database for the user and creating a new one if a user is not existing
- use the connect-mongo package to create a mongoStore and store your sessions in MongoDB
- create a function to test if a user is authenticated and implement it in your desired routes (providing sufficient **authorization**)
- the implementation can look like this:
```javascript
passport.use(
		new Strategy(constants.TWITTER_STRATEGY, (req, token, tokenSecret, profile, cb) => {
  process.nextTick(() => {
    if (!req.user) {
      User.findOne({ 'twitter.id': profile.id }, (err, user) => {
        if (err) return cb(err);
        if (user) {
          if (!user.twitter.token) {
            user.twitter.token = token;
            user.twitter.username = profile.username;
            user.twitter.displayName = profile.displayName;
            user.save(() => {
              if (err) return cb(err);
              return cb(null, user);
            });
          }
          return cb(null, user);
        }

						// if no user is found create one
        const newUser = new User();

        newUser.twitter.id = profile.id;
        newUser.twitter.token = token;
        newUser.twitter.username = profile.username;
        newUser.twitter.displayName = profile.displayName;

        newUser.save(() => {
          if (err) return cb(err);
          return cb(null, newUser);
        });
      });
    } else {
					// when user already exists and is logged in
      const user = req.user;

      user.twitter.id = profile.id;
      user.twitter.token = token;
      user.twitter.username = profile.username;
      user.twitter.displayName = profile.displayName;

      user.save((err) => {
        if (err) return cb(err);
        return cb(null, user);
      });
    }
  });
}),
	);
```

After that your authentication and authorization with twitter is done.

#### Establish local authentication and authorization

The next step is to authenticate locally. There is actually not much to it, since we have already set up the environment.

- first, update your user schema for local (defining email and password)
- add the bcrypt-nodejs package for securing passwords
- add hashing and validating password methods to your Schema
- then define the routes (this process always clarifies what I actually want to implement)
- make sure to differentiate between signup and login!
- I installed EJS as view engine to actually being able to test my signup and login properly
