In ["Understanding MVC Architecture with React"](https://medium.com/@ddcreationstudi/understanding-mvc-architecture-with-react-6cd38e91fefd#.r66jqp0ly) I came to the conclusion that redux seems to be the perfect fit for structuring apps with react. Now I want to provide a roadmap on how to use it in practice.
As a reminder: Redux is builds on Flux as a refined MVC pattern and allows to manage state out of one hand.
