Publishing never has been easier. How can I stand out and put quality thoughts on topics everyone is talking about? How can I set standards for myself to provide the cutting-edge quality people want?
In law school I was able to learn the importance of language. The choice of words can have different consequences - so choose wisely!
Also keep in mind that I am myself have still to learn a lot - be sure to read for inspiration and not for guidance.
Here are some of my thoughts on writing in general and whats important to understand in the year 2017.
